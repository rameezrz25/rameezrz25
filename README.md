Hi, I am currently pursuing Masters in Information Technology at the National Institute of Technolgy, Karnataka. Since joining Mtech, I have greatly enhanced my programming skills by taking up the course on Algorithms and also applied in the projects as a part of the course. I have also worked on diversifying my knowledge and skill set by taking up the course on Machine Learning and loved every bit of developing projects like a Image Classification.
